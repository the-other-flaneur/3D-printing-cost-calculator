# 3D Printing Cost Calculator

A comprehensive calculator for accurately estimating 3D printing costs, helping makers, businesses, and service providers price their projects with precision.


This practical application addresses a real-world need in the 3D printing community by providing accurate cost calculations for printed parts. Built to bridge the gap between design and business, it considers multiple cost factors that affect 3D printing services and personal projects.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Cost Calculation** - Material, electricity, labor, and depreciation costs
- **Multiple Material Support** - PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, and custom materials
- **Energy Cost Integration** - Electricity consumption calculations
- **Time-Based Pricing** - Labor and machine time considerations
- **Printer Configuration** - Support for different printer specifications
-
